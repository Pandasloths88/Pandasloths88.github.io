          <p id="where-p">While I'm sure there are many places to learn HTML and CSS, I use <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/courses">Khan Academy</a>. I know a lot of people have resentment towards it, but I believe it is a really great way to learn many different things. It is entirely free and not limited to HTML/CSS. I also learned the basics of JavaScript on Khan academy, but there are so many other things available. There are courses in math, science, life skills, and many other things. I strongly reccomend Khan Academy; please check to see if there are courses there on anything you are interested in.</p>
